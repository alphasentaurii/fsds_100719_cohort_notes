The order by clause allows you to sort the results by a particular feature. For example, you could sort by the `customerName` column if you wished to get results in alphabetical order. By default, `ORDER BY` is ascending. So, as with the above example, if you want the opposite, use the additional parameter `DESC`. Finally, the limit clause is typically the last argument in a SQL query and simply limits the output to a set number of results.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"rUthL5do0S-o","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tnY9tTDV0GnL","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## The `HAVING` clause"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"p6q7n8Zu0MRG","colab_type":"text"},"source":[" The `HAVING` clause works similarly to the `WHERE` clause, except it is used to filter data selections on conditions **after** the `GROUP BY` clause."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"gTiJPai00hVg","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["cur.execute(\"\"\"SELECT city, COUNT(customerNumber) AS number_customers\n","               FROM customers\n","               GROUP BY 1\n","               HAVING COUNT(customerNumber)>=5;\"\"\")\n","df = pd.DataFrame(cur.fetchall())\n","df. columns = [i[0] for i in cur.description]\n","print(len(df))\n","df.head()"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YpXeKsIw0MAY","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Combining `WHERE` and `HAVING`"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OVskRfdz0mOq","colab_type":"text"},"source":["We can also use the `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses in conjunction with each other for more complex rules.\n","\n","- For example, let's say we want a list of customers who have made at least 3 purchases of over 50K each."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8ylFi-m30sWy","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":221},"outputId":"a8ef2e7f-1047-4de7-f9d7-84644b7667e6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1572307391156,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":616,"user":{"displayName":"James Irving","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mACcEVd68LdN9V-4mJvzZsDjLhNHVOS2V_dwAYB=s64","userId":"14376829558859029468"}}},"source":["cur.execute(\"\"\"SELECT customerName,\n","               COUNT(amount) AS number_purchases_over_50K\n","               FROM customers\n","               JOIN payments\n","               USING(customerNumber)\n","               WHERE amount >= 50000\n","               GROUP BY 1\n","               HAVING count(amount) >= 3\n","               ORDER BY count(amount) DESC;\"\"\")\n","df = pd.DataFrame(cur.fetchall())\n","df. columns = [i[0] for i in cur.description]\n","print(len(df))\n","df.head()"],"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["53\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>customerName</th>\n","      <th>number_purchases_over_50K</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Euro+ Shopping Channel</td>\n","      <td>13</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Mini Gifts Distributors Ltd.</td>\n","      <td>9</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Anna's Decorations, Ltd</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Australian Collectors, Co.</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Baane Mini Imports</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                   customerName  number_purchases_over_50K\n","0        Euro+ Shopping Channel                         13\n","1  Mini Gifts Distributors Ltd.                          9\n","2       Anna's Decorations, Ltd                          4\n","3    Australian Collectors, Co.                          4\n","4            Baane Mini Imports                          4"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zdr7sVmqsIsA","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## `JOIN` STATEMENTS"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"y1t0dZWq1dty","colab_type":"text"},"source":["<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-students/dsc-sql-introduction-online-ds-sp-000/master/images/Database-Schema.png\">"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1FWka0fg1i9k","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Task: Displaying product details along with order details\n","\n","Let's say you need to generate some report that includes details about products from orders.
