    "## Overview - CNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs have certain features that identify patterns in images because of  \"convolution operation\" including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dense layers learn global patterns in their input feature space\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convolution layers learn local patterns, and this leads to the following interesting features:\n",
    "    - Unlike dense networks, local patterns recognized can be recognized _anywhere_ in the images. \n",
    "    - Deeper convolutional neural networks can learn spatial hierarchies.\n",
    "        - A first layer will learn small local patterns, a second layer will learn larger patterns using features of the first layer patterns, etc. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Because of these properties, CNNs are great for tasks like:\n",
    "    - Image classification\n",
    "    - Object detection in images\n",
    "    - Picture neural style transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Convolution works:\n",
    "\n",
    " <img src =\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jirvingphd/dsc-04-43-02-convolutional-neural-networks-online-ds-ft-021119/master/architecture-cnn.png\">\n",
    " \n",
    " - **The Convolution Operation:**\n",
    "    - Detect complex biilding blocks or features that can aid in a larger task. \n",
    "        - i.e. detecting vertical or horizontal edges (example below)<br>\n",
    "        <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jirvingphd/dsc-04-43-02-convolutional-neural-networks-online-ds-ft-021119/master/conv.png\" width=200><br>\n",
    "        - Here, the 3 x 3 matrix on the right represents the _filter_  used to perform a convolution operation to detect horizntal edges.\n",
    "        - The 5x5 image on the left  would by intensity values between 1-255(or rescaled to 1-10)\n",
    "    - **In Keras this is perfomed by a `Conv2d` layer.**\n",
    "        - Applies the convolution filter to every possible 3x3 region posible (for above example) <br>\n",
    " <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jirvingphd/dsc-04-43-02-convolutional-neural-networks-online-ds-ft-021119/master/convolution-layer-a.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Padding:**\n",
    "- Some issues arise using filteres on images.\n",
    "    - Image shrinks with each convolution layer.\n",
    "        - Examples:\n",
    "            - Start with a 5x5 image and use a 3x3 convolution matrix, result is 3x3 image. \n",
    "            - Start with a 10x10 image and use a 3x3 conv matrix, result is 8x8 image. \n",
    "    - The pixels around the edges are used much less in the outputs due to the filter. \n",
    "- Padding solves these issues \n",
    "    - Adding one layer of pixels around the edges preserves the image size with a 3x3 filter. \n",
    "    - Example: padding our 5x5 image (so it becomes a 6x6 image), we can now use a 3x3 conv filter and the resulting image is stil 5x5.\n",
    "- Padding terminology:\n",
    "    - 'Valid' - no padding.\n",
    "    - 'Same' - padding such that the output is the same size. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strided convolutions**\n",
    "    - Stride = how the filter moves over the image. \n",
    "        - Increasing stride so that it moves 2 pixels over instead of 1 results in a smaller # of locations.\n",
    "        - Rarely used in practice, but important option for some models. \n",
    " \n",
    "### Convolutions with color images: \n",
    "- Let's assume a 7x7 RGB, which becomes a 7 x 7 x 3 tensor. \n",
    "    - Will need to use a filter that has the third dimension as 3. \n",
    "    - Can use to detect features on individual color channels.\n",
    "- Can deconvolve with several 3D filters, then stack the output results together. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantage: your image can be huge and the amount of parameters only depends on how many _filters_ used.**\n",
    "    - Lets say we have 20 3x3x3(color) images \n",
    "        - Would have $20 * 27 + a_bias_for_each_filter (1*20) = 560$ parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Notation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $f^{[l]}$ = size of the filter\n",
    "    - $p^{[l]}$ = padding\n",
    "    - $s^{[l]}$ = amount of stride\n",
    "    - $ n_c^{[l]}$ = number of filters\n",
    "    - filter: $f^{[l]}$ x $f^{[l]}$ x $ n_c^{[l-1]}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input =  $n_h^{[l-1]} * n_w^{[l-1]} * n_c^{[l-1]}$\n",
    "- Output = $n_h^{[l]} * n_w^{[l]} * n_c^{[l]}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Height and width are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $n_h^{[l]}= \\Bigr\\lfloor\\dfrac{n_h^{[l-1]}+2p^{[l]}-f^{[l]}}{s^{[l]}}+1\\Bigr\\rfloor$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $n_w^{[l]}= \\Bigr\\lfloor\\dfrac{n_w^{[l-1]}+2p^{[l]}-f^{[l]}}{s^{[l]}}+1\\Bigr\\rfloor$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Activations: $a^{[l]}$ is of dimension $ n_h^{[l]} * n_w^{[l]} * n_c^{[l]} $\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pooling Layers\n",
    "- After Conv layers, intended to significantly downsample the previous convolution layer.\n",
    "    - After conv layers detect edges/patterns, poooling layers will take a summary of the convoltuions from a larger section.\n",
    "    - Most common pooling layer is MaxPooling\n",
    "        - Takes the maximum of all convolutions from a larger area of the iamge. \n",
    "        - Works better than average pooling.\n",
    "- Downsampling is essential for viable executin times. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **MaxPooling Hyperparameters:**\n",
    "    - Parameter names:\n",
    "        - filter_size (f)\n",
    "        - stride (S)\n",
    "    - Common combinations:\n",
    "        - f=2, s=2\n",

    "Up till now, we have frozen the entire convolutional base. Again, it cannot be stressed enough how important this is before fine tuning the weights of the later layers of this base. Without training a classifier on the frozen base first, there will be too much noise in the model and initial epochs will overwrite any useful representations encoded in the pretrained model. That said, now that we have tuned a classifier to the frozen base, we can now unfreeze a few of the deeper layers from this base and further fine tune them to our problem scenario. In practice, this is apt to be particularly helpful where adapted models span new domain categories. For example, if the pretrained model is on cats and dogs and this is adapted to a problem specific to cats (a very relatively similar domain) there is apt to be little performance gain from fine tuning. On the other hand, if the problem domain is more substantially different, additional gains are more likely in adjusting these more abstract layers of the convolutional base.

    "### Using Pretrained Word Vectors with GloVe\n",
    "- Best to load a top-tier industry-standard word mdels\n",
    "    - Most common is Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) from the Stanford NLP Group.\n",
    "    - Loading in weights removes the need to instantiate a Word2Vec model. \n",
    "- **Instead, the process is:**\n",
    "    1. Get the total vocabulary of our data\n",
    "    2. Download and unzip the GloVe file needed from Standford NLP\n",
    "    3. Read the GloVe file, save only vectors for words in our dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **File must be downloaded manually:**\n",
    "    - Must download the zip file for the Stanford Groups pretrained vectors [here.](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)(Lab used the smallest one (which is still 6 B words)\n",
    "    - Place the downloaded file directly into same folder as jupyter notebook.\n",
    "- **To use in python;**    \n",
    "    - First, must tokenize the words in the vocab as done above with nltk.\n",
    "    - Second, must turn the vocabulary into a `set`:\n",
    "        `total_vocabulary = set(word for headline in data for word in headline)`\n",
    "    - Third, load in the glove file, check for and keep only the words that are inside of total_vocabulary\n",
    "```python\n",

    "```\n",
    "- The code above has created a dictionary called `glove, which contains all of the vectors for our data's vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "- Just loading in vectors does not describe sentence, only individual words.\n",
    "- To classify text, we need to calculate ***Mean Word Embeddings***. \n",
    "    - Simply get the vector for every word in a sentence and take the average.\n",
    "    - Mean Word vectors will always match the size of each individual word, no matter how many words appear in a sentence. \n",

    "    - Long Short Term Memory Cells\n",
    "- For deep learning, add **Embedding Layers** into the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Embedding Layer Requirements**\n",
    "    - Learn the word embeddings for our data 'on the fly', get the benefits of Word2Vec without needing to train a Word2Vec model separately.\n",
    "    - Embedding Layers must always be the FIRST layer, immediately below the Input() layer.\n",
    "    - All words in the text must be integer-encoded (each word its own unique integer)\n",
    "    - Size of the embedding layer MUST be greater than the total vocabulary size\n",
    "        - First parameter denotes vocab size, the second parameter denotes word vector size. \n",
